 #  Smart Expense Tracker (Core Java + Swing)

A *GUI-based Smart Expense Tracker* built using *Core Java* to manage daily expenses efficiently.  
This project demonstrates strong fundamentals of *OOPS, Collections, and Exception Handling* using a real-world use case.

---

## Project Overview

The Smart Expense Tracker allows users to:
- Add daily expenses
- Categorize expenses
- View all expenses in a tabular format
- Validate inputs using custom exception handling

The application is *desktop-based* and developed using *Java Swing*, without any database or external frameworks.

##  Technologies Used

- *Language:* Java (Core Java)
- *GUI:* Java Swing
- *Collections:* ArrayList, List
- *Exception Handling:* Custom Exceptions
- *IDE:* IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse
- *JDK:* Java 8+
